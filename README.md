# hxLINQ

An implementation of LINQ in Haxe.

Originally based on the [LINQ to JavaScript (JSLINQ)](http://jslinq.codeplex.com Project),
but was heavily modified to bring it closer to the original C# LINQ.

## Usage

You can refer to the original [LINQ documentation](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb308959.aspx)/[API list](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.linq.enumerable_methods.aspx), 
or look at *Test.hx*.

Haxe user should find it very similar to the [Lambda](http://api.haxe.org/Lambda.html) class.
hxLINQ is Array based and basically a super set of Lambda.
